Face Recognition Attendance System 
This project is a Python-based Face Recognition Attendance System with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It uses the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to detect and recognize faces in real-time through your webcam, automatically marking attendance in a CSV file.

Features:
Real-time face detection via webcam

Face encoding and recognition using face_recognition

Automatically logs recognized faces with timestamp in attendance.csv

User-friendly GUI with Start/Stop camera buttons

Easy integration of new users by adding images to the images/ folder

How It Works
Known Faces:
The app loads all images from the images/ folder, encodes them, and stores their names for recognition.

Live Camera Feed:
Once the camera is started, it captures frames and checks for known faces.

Face Recognition & Logging:
If a face is recognized, it draws a bounding box with the name and logs the name with the current timestamp in attendance.csv.

Requirements:

Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

face_recognition

numpy

Pillow

tkinter (comes with Python)

Install dependencies with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy Pillow
How to Use
Add clear face images to the images/ folder. File name = personâ€™s name.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Use the GUI to start/stop the camera.

Recognized faces will be logged in attendance.csv.
